Cloutik is a cloud management solution for RouterOS routers. Tarik Moussaoui, co-founder of Cloutik.com, reached out to me on LinkedIn to recreate their already existing WordPress website, as it was old and slow, which hurt the image of the project. We had several online meetings, to finally settle on GatsbyJS (a React meta-framework) for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Strapi CMS to manage the content on the backend.

I started working on the project by redesigning the website using Figma to give it a better aesthetic look. Then, I began the coding process.

## challenges :

I encountered some challenges along the way. The website had to support multiple languages, as the project had many instances across Asia, Europe, America, and Africa. The challenge I faced was that Gatsby didn't have a solution out of the box within its plugin ecosystem for internationalization with CMS. Therefore, I had to dive deep into the low-level Gatsby, without using internationalization Gatsby plugins.

At that time, I had a full-time job, so my time was very tight, but I succesfully managed it.

## Client feedback :

> I had an excellent experience with Zakaria for the development of the showcase website Cloutik.com with Gatsby. The final result is both fast and aesthetic, perfectly meeting my expectations. Zakaria was professional, responsive, and was able to adapt to all of my requests. I highly recommend his services for any web project.
